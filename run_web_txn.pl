# part of postgresql buildfarm suite.

# The comments below now only apply to older Msys installations (where
# the native SDK perl version is < 5.8).
# All other installations now do not need to set aux_path, nor should this
# script be called.
#
# auxiliary script to get around the
# fact that the SDK perl for MSys can't do the web
# transaction part. On Windows the shebang line
# must be set to a perl that has the required packages below.
# I have only tested with ActiveState perl, and on my Windows machine
# the line reads: #!/c/perl/bin/perl
#
# Unix  and Cygwin users should set the shebang line to be the same
# as the one in run_build.pl.
#
# All users need to set the aux_path setting in their config files
# to be an absolute or relative path to this script. If relative, then
# it must be relative to <buildroot>/<$branch>. The reason for this crazy
# setup is so that this script does not need to change directory
# at all, which lets us get around virtual path craziness that we
# encounter on MSys.
